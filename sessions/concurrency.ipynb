    "Coroutines can yield the control using the `await` statement (or `yield from` in Python < 3.5), which allows us to get something that is similar to multi-threading, but where the control switches occur in specific, designated, places in the code, and are entirely managed by us. This is in contrast to theads, in which control switches are managed by the operating system, which requires us (sometimes) to use locks and semaphors in order to make sure that our data stays \"whole\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Async programming with coroutines can enchance runtime in I/O-bouded programs, and the programmatic overhead is relatively small (as can be seen below). Moreover, coroutines are much cheaper than threads, in terms of their memory footprint, and therefore we can spawn thousands of them, while we cannot afford to spawn thousands of threads.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see an implementation of the above using async programming: we define the coroutine, which uses the *aiohttp* package to read files from the web instead of the *urllib* package: *aiohttp* does async HTTP requests and responses (both for servers and clients). We then instantiate the coroutines (much like we would do with generators, rather than functions). We create an event loop (using the standard library module *asyncio*), which will be responsible for running the coroutines and handling the switching of flow between them, give the loop all the coroutines, and run the loop. Lastly, We collect the async results and print them."
